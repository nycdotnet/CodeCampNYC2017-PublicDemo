Welcome!

I'm [Steve Ognibene](http://www.pluralsight.com/author/steve-ognibene) and I gave a talk at [Code Camp NYC 2017](https://codecampnyc.org/) on October 14, 2017 called *Practical TypeScript 2 Migration*.  In the talk, I showed how to convert an existing web project that uses JavaScript to TypeScript.

I will add some more details soon, but this repo has the code I showed during the talk.  The [slides are here](slides.pdf).  Please note the LICENSE.md file contains details of how the files in this repository are licensed to you.

For now, the master branch reflects the state of the repository at the conclusion of the talk.  If you want the "before" code, switch to the `actual-demo` branch.
